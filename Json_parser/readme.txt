(copied from readme.md)

Very low footprint DOM-style JSON parser written in portable C89 (sometimes referred to as ANSI C).

* BSD licensed with no dependencies (i.e. just drop `json.c` and `json.h` into your project)
* Never recurses or allocates more memory than it needs to represent the parsed JSON
* Very simple API with operator sugar for C++

Installing
----------

There is now a makefile which will produce a libjsonparser static and dynamic library.  However, this
is _not_ required to build json-parser, and the source files (`json.c` and `json.h`) should be happy
in any build system you already have in place.


API
---
```c
json_value * json_parse (const json_char * json,
                         size_t length);

json_value * json_parse_ex (json_settings * settings,
                            const json_char * json,
                            size_t length,
                            char * error);

void json_value_free (json_value *);
```
The `type` field of `json_value` is one of:

* `json_object` (see `u.object.length`, `u.object.values[x].name`, `u.object.values[x].value`)
* `json_array` (see `u.array.length`, `u.array.values`)
* `json_integer` (see `u.integer`)
* `json_double` (see `u.dbl`)
* `json_string` (see `u.string.ptr`, `u.string.length`)
* `json_boolean` (see `u.boolean`)
* `json_null`


Compile-Time Options
--------------------
Unless otherwise specified, compile definitions must be provided both when 
compiling `json.c` and when compiling any of your own source files that include `json.h`.

### `JSON_TRACK_SOURCE`
Stores the source location (line and column number) inside each `json_value`.

This is useful for application-level error reporting.


### `json_int_t`
By default, `json_int_t` is defined as `long` under C89 and `int_fast64_t` 
otherwise. For MSVC it is defined as `__int64` regardless of language standard support.

Optionally, you may define `json_int_t` to be your own preferred type name for 
integer types parsed from JSON documents. It must be a signed integer type, 
there is no support for unsigned types. If you specify a raw primitive type 
without `signed` or `unsigned` (and not a typdef), `JSON_INT_MAX` will be 
calculated for you. Otherwise, you must provide your own definition of 
`JSON_INT_MAX` as the highest positive integer value that can be represented by 
`json_int_t`.

Example usage:
* `-Djson_int_t=short`
* `"-Djson_int_t=signed char" -DJSON_INT_MAX=127`
* `"-Djson_int_t=long long"`
* `-Djson_int_t=__int128`


Runtime Options
---------------
```c
settings |= json_enable_comments;
```
Enables C-style `// line` and `/* block */` comments.
```c
size_t value_extra
```
The amount of space (if any) to allocate at the end of each `json_value`, in
order to give the application space to add metadata.
```c
void * (* mem_alloc) (size_t, int zero, void * user_data);
void (* mem_free) (void *, void * user_data);
```
Custom allocator routines.  If NULL, the default `malloc` and `free` will be used.

The `user_data` pointer will be forwarded from `json_settings` to allow application
context to be passed.


Changes in version 1.1.0
------------------------

* UTF-8 byte order marks are now skipped if present

* Allows cross-compilation by honoring --host if given (@wkz)

* Maximum size for error buffer is now exposed in header (@LB--)

* GCC warning for `static` after `const` fixed (@batrick)

* Optional support for C-style line and block comments added (@Jin-W-FS)

* `name_length` field added to object values

* It is now possible to retrieve the source line/column number of a parsed `json_value` when `JSON_TRACK_SOURCE` is enabled

* The application may now extend `json_value` using the `value_extra` setting

* Un-ambiguate pow call in the case of C++ overloaded pow (@fcartegnie)

* Fix null pointer de-reference when a non-existing array is closed and no root value is present

JSON summary:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. 
JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions 
that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages

JSON is built on two structures:

    A collection of name/value pairs.
    An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, 
    vector, list, or sequence.

An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs. An object begins with {left 
brace and ends with }right brace. Each name is followed by :colon and the 
name/value pairs are separated by ,comma.

An array is an ordered collection of values. An array begins with [left bracket 
and ends with ]right bracket. Values are separated by ,comma.

A value can be a string in double quotes, or a number, or true or false or null, 
or an object, or an array. These structures can be nested.

A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters, wrapped in double quotes, 
using backslash escapes. A character is represented as a single character string. 
A string is very much like a C or Java string.

A number is very much like a C or Java number, except that the octal and hexadecimal 
formats are not used. The format is: <digit(s)>[.<digit(s)][E[<sign>]<digits>]
The parts in [] square brackets not required (not used for integers)

true, false and null values are encoded as "true", "false" and "null".

Whitespace can be inserted between any pair of tokens.
