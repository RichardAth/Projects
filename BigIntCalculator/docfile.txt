[EXPRESSION]
You can enter expressions that use the following operators, also functions 
and parentheses:
^ or ** : exponentiation (the exponent must be greater than or equal to zero).
*       : multiplication
/       : integer division
%       : modulus (remainder from integer division)
+       : addition
-       : subtraction
SHL or <<: Shift left the number of bits specified on the right operand.
SHR or >>: Shift right the number of bits specified on the right operand.
<, >, <=, >= for comparisons.  The operators return zero for false and -1 for true.
==, != for equality. The operators return zero for false and -1 for true.
NOT, AND, XOR, OR  for bitwise operations.
n!      : factorial (n must be greater than or equal to zero).
n!!     : double factorial (n must be greater than or equal to zero).
p#      : primorial (product of all primes less or equal than p).
C       : binomial coefficient. nCk = n!/(k!*(n-k)!) but is more efficient

#(primorial) !(factorial) and !!(double factorial) operators have the highest priority, 
above NOT and unary -, which are above ^ (exponentiation)
The normal rules for operator precedence and use of brackets to over-ride the 
default order of evaluation apply.

[FUNCTION]
B(n)    : Previous probable prime before n
F(n)    : Fibonacci number Fn
L(n)    : Lucas number Ln = F(n-1) + F(n+1)
N(n)    : Next probable prime after n
P(n)    : Unrestricted Partition Number (number of decompositions of n into sums of 
          integers without regard to order)
Pi(n)   : Number of primes <= n
Gcd(m, n)       : Greatest common divisor of m and n.
Modinv(m, n)    : inverse of m modulo n, only valid when gcd(m, n) = 1.
Modpow(m, n, r) : finds m^n modulo r Equivalent to m^n%r but more efficient.
Totient(n)      : finds the number of positive integers less than n which are 
                  relatively prime to n.
IsPrime(n)      : returns zero if n is not probable prime, -1 if it is.
BPSW(n)         : Baillie–PSW primality test. It returns zero if n is composite, 
                  1 for probable prime, 2 for definite prime. 
                  considered to be 100% reliable for numbers up to 10000 digits
APRCL(n)        : Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test. returns zero if n is 
                  composite, 1 for probable prime (only if BPSW used), 2 for 
                  definite prime. WARNING: very slow for large numbers 
                  e.g. 20s for 400 digits
                  If the number is > 6021 digits it reverts to the BPSW test.
NumDivs(n)      : Number of positive divisors of n either prime or composite.
SumDivs(n)      : Sum of positive divisors of n either prime or composite.
NumDigits(n, r) : Number of digits of n in base r.
SumDigits(n, r) : Sum of digits of n in base r.
RevDigits(n, r) : finds the value obtained by writing backwards the digits of n 
                  in base r.
Sqrt(n)         : square root of n
Nroot(n, r)     : rth root of n e.g.r=3 for cube root
NumFact(n)      : number of distinct prime factors of n.
MinFact(n)      : minimum prime factor of n.
MaxFact(n)      : maximum prime factor of n
LLT(n)          : perform Lucas-Lehmer test. Return 0 if 2^n-1 is composite, 
                  1 if prime.
FactConcat(m,n) : Concatenates the prime factors of n according to the mode m
R2(n)           : Number of ways n can be expressed as the sum of x^2+y^2.  
                  (order andsign of x and y are significant)
R3(n)           : Number of ways n can be expressed as the sum of x^2+y^2+z^2. 
                  (order and sign of x and y are significant)
LE(a,p) : Legendre value for (a/p)
JA(a,p) : Jacobi value for (a/p). If p is prime the result is zero when a is a multiple of p
          it is one if there is a solution of x² = a (mod p) and it is equal to -1 when the
          congruence has no solution.
KR(a,p) : Kronecker value for (a/p)

[YAFU]
The YAFU command controls factorisation using YAFU:

   YAFU ON   Turns on factorisation using YAFU (and turns Msieve off)
   YAFU OFF  Turns off factorisation using YAFU (revert to built-in ECM and SIQS)
   YAFU PATH Displays or changes path used when starting YAFU
   YAFU LOG  Displays path & file name for YAFU output file
   YAFU PLAN <name> 
             where <name> is NONE, NOECM, LIGHT, NORMAL, or DEEP.
             These correspond to the -plan options documented in YAFU's
             docfile.txt file. The default is NORMAL. This is a convenient way
             to control the amount of testing using ECM before switching to SIQS 
             or NFS.

YAFU is on by default but can be turned off by the "YAFU OFF" command and turned 
back on by the YAFU ON command (which also turns Msieve off). The default path to 
access YAFU is hard coded in yafu.cpp and should be changed to whatever is appropriate.

The command YAFU PATH will display the current path and verify that the yafu-X64.exe 
file exists.
The command YAFU PATH SET will display a windows explorer style window where 
you can navigate to the correct folder then click on the yafu exe file. The new path 
to the YAFU file will then be saved in the BigIntCalculator.ini file.

The command YAFU INI will check whether the YAFU.ini file exist. If it does it is
read and any ggnfs_dir parameter is found. If ggnfs_dir is found the path that it 
contains is checked by checking for the existence of the gnfs-lasieve4iXXe.exe files,
where XX is between 11 and 16. Note that YAFU INI requires the YAFU path to already 
be set correctly (by YAFU PATH or otherwise).

The command YAFU INI I allows the ggnfs_dir parameter to be altered or created. It
will display a windows explorer style window where you can navigate to the correct 
folder then click on any file. The new path to the ggnfs files will then be saved
in the ggnfs_dir parameter of the YAFU.ini file.

[MSIEVE]
Msieve is off by default but can be turned on by the "MSIEVE ON" command (which 
also turns YAFU off) and turned back off by the MSIEVE OFF command. The path to 
access msieve should be changed to whatever is appropriate.

MSIEVE PATH will display the current path and verify that the msieve.exe 
file exists.
MSIEVE PATH SET will display a windows explorer style window where you can 
navigate to the correct folder then click on the Msieve exe file. The new path 
to the Msieve file will then be saved in the BigIntCalculator.ini file.

MSIEVE E ON turns on the E option in Msieve for 'deep' ECM
MSIEVE E off turns off the E option

MSIEVE N ON turns on the N option to use the Number Field sieve for factorisation.
MSIEVE N OFF turns off the N option.
