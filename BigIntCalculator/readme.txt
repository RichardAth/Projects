INTRODUCTION

This is a calculator and factorisation program based on Dario Alpert's program.
See https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM

It factorises numbers or numeric expressions using fast algorithms ECM and SIQS.
ECM = Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra_elliptic-curve_factorization
SIQS = Self-initializing quadratic sieve
see http://www.mersennewiki.org/index.php/Self-Initializing_Quadratic_Sieve
or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_sieve

HISTORY

the program was converted from browser-based to a console window. The advantage
is that it is somewhat faster, and the calculator part has been carefully tested.
The disadvantage is that you have to download and build it. In order to do that
you need GMP or MPIR multi-precision library and the Boost multi-precision library.

the following changes were made:

C++ rather than C

The calculator part was extensively rewritten to use GMP/MPIR extended precision
and the Boost multiprecision library. Wherever possible GMP functions were used
instead of DAs version.

Hexadecimal output is turned on with the X command and turned off with D.
If numbers are displayed in hexadecimal they are preceded by 0x. If the number is
negative it is displayed in 2s complement form, and the 1st digit will be in the 
range 8 to f. If necessary an extra f is added at the beginning e.g. -129 is 
displayed as 0xf7f. If the number is positive the 1st digit will be in the range 
0 to 7. If necessary an extra 0 is added at the beginning e.g 128 is displayed as 
0x080

GMP functions used include:
mpz_probable_prime_p        test if prime
mpz_fac_ui                  factorial
mpz_2fac_ui                 double factorial
mpz_fib_ui                  fibonacci
mpz_gcd                     Greatest Common Denominator
mpz_invert                  modular inversion
mpz_lucnum_ui               Lucas number
mpz_nextprime               get next prime
mpz_powm                    modular exponent
mpz_primorial_ui            primorial
mpz_pow_ui                  exponent
mpz_mul_2exp                left shift
mpz_fdiv_q_2exp             right shift
mpz_xor                     bitwise exclusive or
mpz_ior                     bitwise inclusive or
mpz_and                     bitwise and

Standard arithmetic operators for extended precision values use the Boost library,  
which implements them using GMP/MPIR functions.

The PARTITION function was rewritten as DAs version initially had a bug and an 
alternative that worked was already available.

FACTORIZATION

The BigInteger structure was turned into a C++ class and various operators were 
overloaded to work with with BigIntegers. Wherever possible, BigInteger function
calls have been replaced with statements using arithmetic or comparison
operators. 

As mentioned above it uses algorithms ECM and SIQS.

At all stages a factor list is maintained that contains all known factors, whether
prime or not, that have not yet been split into smaller factors. Initially the
factor list just contains the number to be factorised. Whenever a new factor is found,
existing factors that are multiples of that factor are split into two factors. If
this process creates equal factors they are merged. 

Step 1: if number to factor is > than the the square of the largest prime to be used in trial
division, check if the number is a perfect power +/- 1 and if so attempt to factorise it.
This step may return factors that are not prime factors.

Step 2: Try to factorise each factor (there may already be more than 1) by trial division 
using a list of primes. If a factor is found that is: 
    less than the cube of the largest prime used and 
    has no factors in the list of primes, and 
    the factor is not prime 
(in this case the factor can only have two prime factors) 
factorise it using Pollard's Rho algorithm. 

Step 3: For each factor that is not already known to be prime:
A. If the factor is a perfect power replace it with the number which is the root 
   (and adjust the the factor's exponent accordingly)
B. Test whether the number is prime: 
   If it is a Carmichael number factorise it using a specific algorithm. 
   If it is prime mark it as such. 
   Otherwise factorise it using ECM, SIQS and Lehman algorithms

The factoriser is essentially DAs program, with an interface function that converts 
GMP/MPIR extended precision numbers to DAs BigIntegers and vice versa. The progress 
messages it produces have been modified to work with a console window instead of a 
Web Browser. 

A couple of checks for overflows were added. If an error is detected 
an exception is thrown, an error message is output, and the program continues 
without factorising the number. Realistically any number small enough to be 
factorised in a reasonable time will not cause an overflow.

Profiling using Visual Studio suggests that changing from DAs BigIntegers to 
GMP/MPIR would not improve performance much. This would be a huge task.

the time taken to factorise a large number is unpredictable e.g.

1000 000000 000000 000000 008970 000000 000000 000000 014661 000000 000000 000000 006097 (76 digits)
= 1 000000 000000 000000 000007 * 10 000000 000000 000000 000013 * 100 000000 000000 000000 000067
took 291 seconds

40526 919504 877216 755680 601905 432322 134980 384796 226602 145184 481280 000000 000000 (77 digits)
 = 2^53 * 3^27 * 5^13 * 7^9 * 11^5 * 13^4 * 17^3 * 19^3 * 23^2 * 29 * 31 * 37 * 41 * 43 * 47 * 53
 took 0.054 seconds. The larger number was factorised in about 1/5000 of the time!

 The time required depends mainly on the size of the 2nd largest factor, but you don't
 know what that is in advance.

comparision operators <, <=, ==, !=, >, and >= are similar in all three. The calculator
returns -1 for true, 0 for false. This allows this allows AND, OR, XOR and NOT to operate
on the returned values as if they were boolean variables.

#(primorial) !(factorial) and !!(double factorial) operators have the highest priority, 
above ^ (exponentiation)
The normal rules for operator precedence and use of brackets to over-ride the default order
of evaluation apply.

                                    which are relatively prime to n.
IsPrime(n)                          returns zero if n is not probable prime, -1 if it is.

Some functions and operators limit the range of their parameters:

                                    before calculation and if it appears to be > 20,000
                                    digits an error will be reported.
*                                   result is estimated before calculation and if it
